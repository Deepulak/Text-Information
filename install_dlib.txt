Install OS libraries


sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libboost-python-dev

Install Python libraries

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python3-dev python3-pip
sudo -H pip2 install -U pip numpy
sudo -H pip3 install -U pip numpy


We will use Virtual Environment to install Python libraries. It is generally a good practice in order to separate your project environment and global environment

# Install virtual environment
sudo pip2 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
sudo pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
echo "# Virtual Environment Wrapper" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
 
############ For Python 2 ############
# create virtual environment
mkvirtualenv facecourse-py2 -p python2
workon facecourse-py2
 
# now install python libraries within this virtual environment
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn ipython
 
# quit virtual environment
deactivate
######################################
 
############ For Python 3 ############
# create virtual environment
mkvirtualenv facecourse-py3 -p python3
workon facecourse-py3
 
# now install python libraries within this virtual environment
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn ipython
 
# quit virtual environment
deactivate

Davis King, creator of Dlib, recommends using CMake for using Dlib in your code.
But if you want to use Dlib as a library follow these steps:

wget http://dlib.net/files/dlib-19.6.tar.bz2
tar xvf dlib-19.6.tar.bz2
cd dlib-19.6/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ..


Now you can use pkg-config to provide path to Dlib’s include directory and link Dlib library file.

pkg-config --libs --cflags dlib-1


Compile Python module
Activate Python virtual environment


############ For Python 2 ############
workon facecourse-py2

############ For Python 3 ############
workon facecourse-py3


Now let’s compile and install Dlib’s Python module.


# move to dlib's root directory
cd dlib-19.6
python setup.py install
# clean up(this step is required if you want to build dlib for both Python2 and Python3)
rm -rf dist
rm -rf tools/python/build
rm python_examples/dlib.so

If you are going to use only Python module of Dlib you can also install Python bindings for Dlib using pip.
1
	pip install dlib

Now you can exit from Python virtual environment.
1
	deactivate

Now, whenever you are going to run Python scripts which use Dlib you have to activate the virtual environment using workon command.

About

I am an entrepreneur with a love for Computer Vision and Machine Learning with a dozen years of experience (and a Ph.D.) in the field.

In 2007, right after finishing my Ph.D., I co-founded TAAZ Inc. with my advisor Dr. David Kriegman and Kevin Barnes. The scalability, and robustness of our computer vision and machine learning algorithms have been put to rigorous test by more than 100M users who have tried our products. Read More…
