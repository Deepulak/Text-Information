Howto build/install

    You will need to blacklist another driver in order to use this one.
    echo "blacklist r8188eu" >> "/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf"
    make && make install
    Reboot in order to blacklist and load the new driver/module.

MONITOR MODE howto

Use these steps to enter monitor mode.

$ sudo airmon-ng check kill
$ sudo ip link set <interface> down
$ sudo iw dev <interface> set type monitor

Frame injection test may be performed with (after kernel v5.2 scanning is slow, run a scan or simply an airodump-ng first!)

$ aireplay -9 <interface>


NetworkManager configuration

Add these lines below to "NetworkManager.conf" and ADD YOUR ADAPTER MAC below [keyfile] This will make the Network-Manager ignore the device, and therefore don't cause problems.

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[connection]
wifi.powersave=0

[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:A7:A7:A7:A7:A7
